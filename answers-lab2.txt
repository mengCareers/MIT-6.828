1. uintptr_t
2.
3. Page table/directory entry flags proptect kernel memory. For example, when PTE_U is not enabled, user space cannot visit kernel memory.
4. 2GB
UPAGES use 4MB to store PageInfo structures. Each structure takes 8B, so 512 PageInfo strucutres. The size of a page is 4KB, so total physical memory is 512 * 4KB = 2GB.
5. 6MB + 4KB
4MB for PageInfo structures + 2MB for page table + 4KB for page directory
6. After jmp *%eax
It is possible because the low 4MB of virtual address was mapped to the low 4MB physical address.
It is necessary because it allows user programs to use the low address space.
